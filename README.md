# Waste Disposal Schedule App

This app is made to familiarize myself with Nuxt 3 and Tailwind CSS. It uses the open source **[OpenERZ](https://openerz.metaodi.ch/documentation)** waste collection API of the cities ZÃ¼rich, Thalwil, Basel and St. Gallen. The API is generously provided by **Stefan Oberbolz**.

## Used Technologies and Resources

- [Nuxt 3](https://v3.nuxtjs.org)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [OpenERZ project](https://github.com/metaodi/openerz) by Stefan Oberbolz
